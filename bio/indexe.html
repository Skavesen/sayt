			<h1> Biography </h1>
<h2>Personal development</h2>
<p>At the age of 3, I already went to the Snezhok kindergarten, which was visible from my window. I really enjoyed going to kindergarten, I always participated in all matinees and events, at one of the matinees we staged the fairy tale “Little Red Riding Hood” and I played the main role. My mother also took me to a dance club, my friends from the group also went to this club. The most vivid memory is a birthday gift - a dog, which I really dreamed of.</p>
<p>In 2007, at the age of almost 6 years, I went to the 1st grade of school No. 149 in Donetsk. I enjoyed learning and going to school because almost all the kids in my kindergarten class were in my class. At the end of 1st grade I gave the last call.</p>
<p>The school was very close to my house, but for some reason I was always late for classes and the first teacher always joked that I lived “farthest” from the school.</p>
<p>I studied well and always completed all my homework. After the fourth grade we had graduation, as we were already moving to high school. We celebrated graduation in the children's playroom with animators and aqua makeup was painted on our faces, I was a tiger.</p>
<p>High school was hard at first - new subjects, new teachers and new rules. My favorite subject was English, this subject was taught by the teacher who was our class teacher. I also had a discipline that I didn’t really like and don’t like to this day - physics.</p>
<p>During my time at school I always participated in all events, as well as in various Olympiads and competitions.</p>
<p>In 11th grade, I passed all exams well and scored more points.</p>
<h2>Professional development</h2>
<p>While still at school, I started going to classes at the STEP computer academy. I studied there for 4 years and received a diploma. In the 11th grade, I started going to preparatory classes at DonNTU, namely mathematics. At the end of the courses, we wrote an exam, which I wrote excellently and received additional points upon admission. I entered software engineering at Donetsk National Technical University. But it was not I who chose my profession, but my parents.</p>
<p>In my first year it was very difficult for me - new, incomprehensible subjects, buildings between which I had to travel by trolleybus, and the university was no longer as close to my home as the kindergarten and school. I had to get up at 5:30 every morning to make it to the first class. The road was very tiring, and a large amount of laboratory work still needed to be done. I was no longer as actively involved in the life of the university as I was at school. I was not a member of any clubs.</p>
<p>I was able to get a scholarship only in my 2nd year. I started trying to pass everything on time and get automatic machines, although I didn’t always succeed and had to write exams. I have never had tails or debts.
</p>
<p>In my 4th year I successfully defended my diploma with excellent marks. But of course it was not red, because my diploma had different grades and 3 too.</p>
<p>After I received my diploma, on the same day I went to apply for a master's degree. My parents believe that a bachelor's degree is not a higher education.</p>
<p>I entered the master's program, but unfortunately it was a paid form of study. The first semester I studied for a fee, but I tried and passed all the exams well and was transferred to the budget. Now I am receiving a scholarship.</p>
<p>Just like in my undergraduate studies, Olga Valentinovna became my supervisor. I always liked the subjects she taught, because the material was always clear and presented in an accessible way. If I have any questions, I can always ask Olga Valentinovna and I will receive answers.
</p>
<p>At the moment I am working, but unfortunately not in my specialty. I hope that soon I will find the job that I want and that I will like it, and of course it will be in my specialty.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, I need to complete my studies at the university and defend my thesis perfectly.</p>
<p>I want to say that my university is not only a place where students receive an education, but also a place where they can build their future. Here students make friends for life, find their calling and meaning. I am proud to be a part of this wonderful institution and grateful for everything it provides to its students.</p>
